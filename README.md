# bank-ocr-kata
My implementation of the bank-ocr-kata. At this point I'm around three hours into the implementation, so I didn't really get into the fourth user story. I'll come back to this and implement more, including better test coverage next time I have a few hours of free time.

## Running the project
Assuming the .NET Core 3.0 SDK (beta at this time) is installed, run the following command
```
dotnet run --project BankOcrKata\BankOcrKata.csproj
```

## Running unit tests
To run the unit tests, again assuming the .NET Core 3.0 SDK in installed
```
dotnet test BankOcrKata.Test\BankOcrKata.Test.csproj
```
